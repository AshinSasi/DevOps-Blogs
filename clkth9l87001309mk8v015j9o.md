## **What is Kernel**

Linux Kernel is the heart of Linux operating systems. A kernel is the lowest level of software that can interface with computer hardware.

**The kernel has 4 jobs:**

Memory management: Keep track of how much memory is used to store what, and where

Process management: Determine which processes can use the central processing unit (CPU), when, and for how long

Device drivers: Act as mediator/interpreter between the hardware and processes

System calls and security: Receive requests for service from the processes

## **What is Shell**

The shell is the Linux command line interpreter. It provides an interface between the user and the kernel. It takes commands from the user and sends them to Kernel for execution. The shell gets started when the user logs in or start the terminal.

## **What is Linux Shell Scripting?**

A shell script is a type of computer program developed to be executed by a Unix shell, which is also known as a command-line interpreter. Shell Scripting is a program to write a series of commands for the shell to execute.

## **What is #!/bin/bash? can we write #!/bin/sh as well?**

#!/bin/bash commonly called shebang, is used to instruct the operating system to use bash as a command interpreter.

Yes, you can write #!/bin/sh instead of #!/bin/bash. When you use #!/bin/sh, it instructs the system to use the system's default shell to execute the script.

eg. Below I have added a sample bash script to print a statement.

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash

#write a Shell Script too print a statement

echo "I will complete #90DaysofDevOps challenge"
```

```plaintext
ubuntu@ip-:~/DevOps$ chmod 700 print.sh

ubuntu@ip-:~/DevOps$ ./print.sh
I will complete #90DaysofDevOps challenge
```

### **Write a Shell Script to take user input and print the variables.**

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash

#Take input from user

echo "Enter User Name:"
read Name


arg_name=$1

#Print the variable

echo "User Name is:$Name"
echo "Argument Taken:$arg_name"
```

Output:

```plaintext
ubuntu@ip-:~/DevOps$ ./variable.sh 7
Enter User Name:
Ashin
User Name is:Ashin
Argument Taken:7
```

## Write an Example of If else in Shell Scripting by comparing 2 numbers

```plaintext
#!/bin/bash

# Taking user input for two numbers
read -p "Enter the first number: " num1
read -p "Enter the second number: " num2

# Comparing the numbers
if [ "$num1" -gt "$num2" ]; then
  echo "$num1 is greater than $num2."
elif [ "$num1" -lt "$num2" ]; then
  echo "$num1 is less than $num2."
else
  echo "Both numbers are equal."
fi
```

OUTPUT:

```plaintext
ubuntu@ip-:~/DevOps$ ./condition.sh
Enter the first number: 5
Enter the second number: 4
5 is greated than 4
```

* `-lt` means less than.
    
* \-gt means greater than
