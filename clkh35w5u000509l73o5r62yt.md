## **What is DevOps?**

DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to unite people, processes, and technology in application planning, development, delivery, and operations. In 2009 [Patrick Debois](https://www.youtube.com/@jedi4ever/featured) described, **DevOps** as not a specific technology, but a tactical approach. By working together, development and operations teams can eliminate roadblocks and focus on improving how they create, deploy, and continuously monitor software.

The DevOps lifecycle consists of eight phases representing the processes, capabilities, and tools needed for development.

1. Plan
    
2. Code
    
3. Build
    
4. Test
    
5. Release
    
6. Deploy
    
7. Operate
    
8. Monitor
    

## Benefits of DevOps

* Faster, better product delivery.
    
* Faster issue resolution and reduced complexity.
    
* Greater scalability and availability.
    
* More stable operating environments.
    
* Better resource utilization.
    
* Greater automation.
    
* Greater visibility into system outcomes.
    
* Greater innovation.
    

## **What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure?**

1. **Automation**
    
    DevOps automation is the practice or discipline of using specialized software tools and methodologies to automate repetitive and manual tasks throughout the software development lifecycle.
    
2. **Scaling**
    
    In simple words, scalable DevOps means the system can expand automatically during a high workload and shrink back when the needs are reduced to normal.
    
3. **Infrastructure**
    
    DevOps infrastructure refers to a concept that revolves around the idea of managing infrastructure with the help of code. This can be achieved using certain tools or programs which can help to carry out the tasks automatically.
