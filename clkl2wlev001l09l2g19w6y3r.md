The purpose of backup is to create a copy of data that can be recovered anytime if you lose your primary data. Since I have started writing Blogs every day, I wanted to back up my blogs so I have a copy of it saved. Hashnode has this wonderful feature that allows you to copy your blogs to GitHub.

Connect to your GitHub Account and follow the below steps to create a repository. You have the option to automatically back up both your old and new articles to a private or public GitHub repository. To begin, follow the steps below.

1. Select your repository and click on New

1. Add a name to your Repository and also you can add a description (optional).
